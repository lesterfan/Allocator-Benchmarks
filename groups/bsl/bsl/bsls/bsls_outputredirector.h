//@PURPOSE: Provide a means for test drivers to redirect and inspect output.
//
//@CLASSES:
//  bsls::OutputRedirector: namespace for low-level logging functions
//
//@MACROS:
//
//@DESCRIPTION: This component provides a mechanism, 'bsls::OutputRedirector',
// to redirect output sent to either of the standard out or error streams and
// capture that output so that it can be read back and parsed, such as to allow
// a test driver to verify the expected output of a streaming operation.
//
// THIS COMPONENT IS IN A PREVIEW STATE AND SHOULD NOT BE USED OUTSIDE OF BDE
// TEST DRIVERS
//
///Usage
///-----
// This section illustrates the intended use of this component, or at least, it
// will once the usage example is written.

// Temp file creation and output redirection re-purposed from the pre-existing
// module in 'bsls_bsltestutil.t.cpp'.

class OutputRedirector {
    // This class provides a facility for redirecting 'stdout' and 'stderr' to
    // temporary files, retrieving output from the respective temporary file
    // and comparing the output to user-supplied character buffers.  An
    // 'OutputRedirector' object can be in an un-redirected state or a
    // redirected state.  If the redirector is in a redirected state, it will
    // redirect either 'stdout' or 'stderr', but not both simultaneously.  An
    // 'OutputRedirector' object has the concept of a scratch buffer, where
    // output captured from the process' 'stdout' or 'stderr' stream is stored
    // when the 'OutputRedirector' object is in the redirected state.
    // Throughout this class, the term "captured output" refers to data that
    // has been written to the 'stdout' or 'stderr' stream and is waiting to be
    // loaded into the scratch buffer.  Each time the 'load' method is called,
    // the scratch buffer is truncated, and the captured output is moved into
    // the scratch buffer.  When this is done, there is no longer any captured
    // output.
