//@PURPOSE: Define paths where native headers can be found.
//
//@MACROS:
// BSL_NATIVE_CPP_LIB_HEADER(header):  path to C++ standard header
// BSL_NATIVE_CPP_RUNTIME_HEADER(header): path to C++ run-time header
// BSL_NATIVE_CPP_C_HEADER(header): path to C++ versions of C standard header
// BSL_NATIVE_CPP_DEPRECATED_HEADER(header): path to deprecated C++ STD header
// BSL_NATIVE_C_LIB_HEADER(header): path to C standard header (end in '.h')
// BSL_NATIVE_OS_RTL_HEADER(header): path to a subset of C standard headers
// BSL_NATIVE_OS_STDDEF_HEADER(header): path to standard C stddef.h header

//@DESCRIPTION: [!PRIVATE!] This component is intended for use only by other
// components in the bsl package group.  The stability of this interface is not
// guaranteed.
//
// The macros in this component allow a source file compiled in bde-stl mode to
// include the compiler's native C++ library headers, even when the compiler's
// search path would otherwise find the headers with the same name in the
// 'bsl+stdhdrs' package.  The actual paths are hard coded to be platform
// specific.
//
// Each macro takes a 'filename' argument and expands to the path for the file
// in the native compiler's directory.  The expanded macros are suitable for
// use in '#include' directives.  In order to find the native file, the correct
// macro must be used for each header file, as follows:
//..
//  Macro                               Used for
//  =================================   ======================================
//  BSL_NATIVE_CPP_LIB_HEADER           Most C++ standard header files
//
//  BSL_NATIVE_CPP_RUNTIME_HEADER       Headers closely related to the
//                                      compiler ('<exception>', '<typeinfo>',
//                                      and '<new>')
//
//  BSL_NATIVE_CPP_C_HEADER             C++ standard versions of the C-language
//                                      library (e.g., '<cstdlib>', '<cctype>')
//
//  BSL_NATIVE_CPP_DEPRECATED_HEADER    Headers to C++ standard header files
//                                      that have been deprecated (<strstream>)
//
//  BSL_NATIVE_C_LIB_HEADER             Headers that are part of the C
//                                      standard library (e.g., '<stdio.h>').
//                                      Note that this will *not* work for
//                                      'errno.h'
//  BSL_NATIVE_OS_RTL_HEADER            Headers that are part of the C
//                                      standard library (e.g., '<stdio.h>')
//                                      but accessed through a special platform
//                                      directory on Windows, unrelated to the
//                                      compiler version, starting with Visual
//                                      C++ 2015.  Note that this will *not*
//                                      work for 'errno.h'
//  BSL_NATIVE_OS_STDDEF_HEADER         The specific location of the <stddef.h>
//                                      header, which needs to be tracked
//                                      separately for, at least, Solaris CC
//                                      C++11 builds, in order to support
//                                      chaining intercept headers with the
//                                      platform standard library.
//..
// Note that 'BSL_NATIVE_C_LIB_HEADER' cannot be used to include the native
// version of 'errno.h' because 'errno' is '#define'd as a macro by several
// standard headers (errno.h, stdlib.h, stddef.h) - hence 'errno' cannot be
// correctly passed as an argument to the macros defined within this component.
//
///Usage
///-----
// The 'bsl+stdhdrs' package provides low-level system facilities, including a
// replacement for some of the features of the C++ standard library.  Under
// bde-stl mode, including headers '<new>', '<vector>', '<strsteam>', and
// '<cstdlib>' as follows:
//..
//  #include <new>
//  #include <vector>
//  #include <strstream>
//  #include <cstdlib>
//..
// will usually find Bloomberg's implementation of standard headers provided in
// the 'bsl+stdhdrs' package.  Sometimes, however, it is necessary to force
// inclusion of the standard headers natively supplied with the compiler.  In
// these cases, one can use the macros in this component, as follows:
//..
//  #include <bsl_bslhdrs_incpaths.h>
//
//  #include BSL_NATIVE_CPP_RUNTIME_HEADER(new)
//  #include BSL_NATIVE_CPP_LIB_HEADER(vector)
//  #include BSL_NATIVE_CPP_DEPRECATED_HEADER(strstream)
//  #include BSL_NATIVE_CPP_C_HEADER(cstring)
//  #include BSL_NATIVE_C_LIB_HEADER(setjmp.h)
//  #include BSL_NATIVE_OS_RTL_HEADER(stdio.h)
//..
// Note that the macros used for '<new>' is different from that used for
// '<vector>' because '<new>' is one of the headers that is closely related to
// the compiler.  Note also that neither the arguments to the macros nor their
// invocations are quoted or enclosed in angle brackets.

// Note that 'bslscm_version.h' is not included here because it pulls in c++
// symbols.  When someone includes a C header file (such as stdio.h) inside an
// 'extern "C"' block, the symbol inside bslscm_version (which is hidden inside
// an unnamed namespace) will be viewed as a C symbol (with the file scope
// ignored), which causes link errors when multiple files defining the version
// symbol are linked together.

extern "C++" {
// Some third party libraries #include standard C headers inside an
// 'extern "C"' block, which can cause problems when our intercept headers
// transitively include code expected to be parsed as C++.  As we cannot fix
// the third party headers, we protect the file that is ubiquitously included
// when intercepting headers.
