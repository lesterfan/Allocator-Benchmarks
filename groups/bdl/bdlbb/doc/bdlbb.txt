@DESCRIPTION: This package defines, 'bdlbb::Blob', a vocabulary type for
 other 'bdl' packages.  A 'bdlbb::Blob' object consists of a sequence of
 'bdlbb::BlobBuffer' objects, each of which have a shared pointer to
 underlying memory.  A protocol is defined for factories to manage
 'bdlbb::BlobBuffer' objects, and a concrete implementation is provided.
 Other components define non-primitive operations on 'bdlbb::Blob's.
